**Note:** The whole report with the details of the project can be found in the pdf file above (that is also in the repository).

An excerpt from the report:\
"The implementation of this project allowed us to better understand the issue of user profiling in recommendation systems, as well as the multitude of problems during the design of such a system. Since the developed system operated on component ratings determined from reviews, we had to adapt it in order to create aggregation of component ratings into one "holistic" numerical value. Thanks to this, however, the model recommends a product with features that the interested user values ​​the most."
